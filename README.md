A low-cost, AI-powered smart parking system that uses ESP32-CAM, computer vision, and a Flask web server to detect parking slot occupancy (Car / Bike / Vacant) in real time.
In large campuses and industrial environments, manual parking monitoring leads to congestion and inefficient space usage.
This project automates parking slot monitoring using image-based detection, eliminating the need for costly physical sensors.
The system captures parking slot images using an ESP32-CAM, sends them to a Flask server, and classifies the slot status using a trained deep learning model. Results are displayed through a web dashboard and can be extended to LED indicators for real-time feedback.
